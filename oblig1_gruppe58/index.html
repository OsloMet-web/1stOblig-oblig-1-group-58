    <h1>Zeats space booking</h1>

    <p>
        Zeats is a cost-effective and sustainable system
        for booking workplaces in an open office landscape.
        The system consists of a website, QR codes, LED lights and a simple computer program.
        The system gives you a simple overview of which places are available,
        allows you to book places quickly, and does not require any new specially produced items
        electronic items. 
    </p>


    <h2>Description of Zeats</h2>

    <p>
        The solution is two-fold, a website that allows you to book places almost the same as other solutions, but with a simpler user interface.
        The solution stands out in the second part, namely that Zeats is incorporated into the workplace using LED lights that show availability.
        To prevent unnecessary custom-made electronic items are the LED lights controlled by a simple computer program
        which is installed on the terminal in the existing ICT system at the workplace.
        The computer program communicates with the website's database
        and updates the color of the lights in real time.
